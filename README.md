# Anomaly detection using LSTM Autoencoder

This code is to show: 
1. How to use LSTM Autoencoder to detect abnormal situations in time series data. The LSTM AE is built on top of Keras with Tensorflow as backend. 
2. How to use Azure Machine Learning SDK to create datastore, dataset and submit experiments
